The aim is to try to find the name of a Pokemon I like that is available as a username in League of Legends. I did this in two files (ListGenerator and NameChecker) so that I could first get a list of all pokemon, and then manually cut down to the ones I wanted and also so I wouldn't have to keep rerunning the code to generate the list of pokemon. I've also joined them in case I want to run this on a new device without having to specify the paths of where to read and write the files to.
